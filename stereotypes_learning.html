        <h3>Stereotypes Disrupt Probabilistic Category Learning</h3>
        <p></p>

        <hr />
        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>Racial stereotypes exert pernicious effects on decision-making and behavior, yet little is known about how stereotypes disrupt people’s ability to learn new associations.
          We interrogate a fundamental question about the boundary conditions of probabilistic learning by examining whether and how new learning is influenced by pre-existing associations</p>

          <h3>Method</h3>
          <h4>Participants</h4>
          <P>Participants (N = 696 across 3 studies) were recruited from the University of California SONA pool. The sample had a mean age of 20.01, SD = 3.32 (63% self-identified female, and 37% self-identified male) and was 43% Asian, 28% Latino, 11% White, 8% Other, and 6% Black. </P>
          <h4>Personality Measures</h4>

          <h4>Procedure</h4>
          <P>Schematic of the learning task in the Crime Face (A) and Weather Cloud (B) conditions. Participants learned the probabilities of the card patterns by selecting their choice and receiving feedback as to if they were correct or incorrect (right side of stimuli) as well as what the actual outcome was on that trial (left side of stimuli).</P>

          <h3>Drift Diffusion Modeling</h3>

          <p>Drift diffusion modeling decomposes decisions into (1) the starting point of evidence accumulation (z) – a free parameter estimating an a priori preference for one of the two outcomes, and (2) the drift rate (v) – a free parameter estimating the precision with which evidence is accumulated towards the two outcomes.<p>

          <h3>Results</h3>

          <p>Participants required less evidence before correctly predicting that the ingroup candidate was more honest (yellow) compared to the outgroup candidate (purple).
            When the ingroup candidate was more honest, participant’s psychometric function was shifted left compared to when the outgroup candidate was more honest.
          <p> <p>
          (A) Comparison of DIC difference from null model reveals that z & v model performed significantly better than all other models.
          (B & C) Density plots of participants individual posterior parameter estimates. The dashes line in panel B indicates the value of an unbiased parameter. (B) 99% of participants had a posterior drift rate that was positive, indicating that they weighted information that favored the ingroup candidate more than information that favored the outgroup candidate. <p>

          <h3>Discussion</h3>
          <p> We demonstrate that despite financial incentives for accuracy, social motivations internal to the individual bias information processing towards desired conclusions. Partisans required overall less and weaker evidence when correctly categorizing the ingroup as more honest compared to the outgroup, and were more accurate on trials when the ingroup candidate was more honest, compared to the outgroup. DDMs revealed that partisan biases jointly arise as a function of two distinct mechanisms.
            First, pre-existing preferences for believing the ingroup candidate was more honest prepared partisans to conclude that the ingroup was more honest, and therefore they needed less evidence to arrive at this conclusion (i.e., biased starting point). Second, partisans were more precise in accumulating evidence that favored the ingroup candidate compared to the outgroup, resulting in differential weighting of evidence that favored the ingroup (i.e., biased drift rate). <p>
