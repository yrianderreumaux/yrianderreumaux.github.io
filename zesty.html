                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic swept the globe, I found myself with a lot of extra time on my hands, and I spent much of the first summer working on different recipes. As I experimented with different recipes and techniques, I realized that it was difficult to keep track of all the recipes I had created or cooked.
                    This led to the creation of Zesty, a platform where home cooks like me could share and discover new recipes, connect with each other, and exchange tips and inspiration. </p>
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>Create a social cooking platform designed to make creating, sharing and organizing recipes intuitive and hassle free. Try it for free <a href="https://www.getzesty.app/">Here!</a></p>

                <hr />

                <h4>Product Market Fit</h4>
                <p>To validate our intuitions that people really do struggle to organize and share their recipes, we conducted several surveys using a representative sample via CloudResearch (total N=900). Our only selection criteria were that our sample had to be active home cooks (defined as those that cook at least one meal a week).</p>
                <p>Our research found that 83% of home cooks use two or more methods to organize their recipes. The majority also expressed dissatisfaction with their current organization method. When asked whether they would be interested in using a platform like Zesty to organize their recipes, the majority (87%) responded positively.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="images/methods.jpg"  alt="Snow" style="width:100%">
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="images/satisfaction.jpg" alt="Forest" style="width:100%">
                    </div>

                </div>
                <hr />

                <h4>Recipe Creation Flow</h4>
                <P>One of the key features of Zesty is the ability for users to create and share their own recipes. To design a user interface that is easy and intuitive to use, we conducted over 30 usability tests over the course of two months.
                    This allowed us to gather valuable feedback from users and make refinements to the design to maximize the user experience.</P>

                <p> <b>Creating recipes in Zesty consists of five steps:</b></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enter the recipe name and whether you want it to be public or private</li>
                    <li>Cuisine type, time to cook, recipe yield, tags</li>
                    <li>Add ingredients and the amount needed for each ingredient</li>
                    <li>Enter the instructions for preparing the recipe, step by step</li>
                    <li>Add a photo of the finished dish (optional)</li>
                </ol>
                <hr />
                <h4>Importing Recipes</h4>
                <P>One of the key features of Zesty is the ability for users to import recipes from other websites and sources. To enable this feature, I developed a python script that scrapes meta data from recipe websites. This allows users to easily import recipes from their favorite websites and bring them into the Zesty platform. I am currently working on a new feature that will allow users to import recipes based on pictures of recipes.
                    We are in the process of building the frontend design and plan to launch this new feature in the new year. </P>
