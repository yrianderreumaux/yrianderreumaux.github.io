                <p>Yrian is one of three co-founders of <a href="https://www.getzesty.app/">Zesty</a>, a social cooking app designed to help home cooks create, organize, and share their recipes with their friends and family</p>

                <h2 class="major">Market fit</h2>
                <p>During discovery, we found that 75% of home cooks claim to use two or more methods to organize their recipes (e.g., on paper, website urls, screenshots). Of those, 68% expressed frustration with their current organization method, such as difficulty finding previously cooked recipes or sharing recipes with others. This led us to create Zesty –– which offers a simple web-based solution to streamline the process of creating, organizing, and sharing recipes.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Personalized Recommendation Engine</h2>
                <p>Our market research revealed that over 90% of people who visit recipe websites do so for inspiration about what to cook. Another 78% said they trust recommendations from their friends and family more than recommendations from recipe websites. We used this information to build a personalized recommendation engine that allows users to discover new recipes based on their personal tastes and preferences.</p>
                    Yrian applied his knowledge from graduate school to develop and deploy a deep collaborative filtering recommendation engine using Tensorflow, which is hosted on google cloud platform. The model uses users past interactions to generate a list of recommended recipes based on the preferences and behavior of similar users. The model uses a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture, with multiple hidden layers of neurons to learn complex nonlinear relationships between the user and recipe features.</p>

                <h2 class="major">Importing recipes from other websites</h2>
                <p>Many home cooks struggle to organize their recipes. Often times, this is because recipes are stored in different places. Our newest feature allows users to easily import recipes from other websites, thereby allowing them to keep track of all their recipes in one place. Each recipe is stored in the same format, which also makes it easy to follow when you are cooking. </p>
