        <h3>Research Question</h3>
        <p>Racial stereotypes exert pernicious effects on decision-making and behavior, yet little is known about how stereotypes disrupt people’s ability to learn new associations.
          We interrogate a fundamental question about the boundary conditions of probabilistic learning by examining whether and how new learning is influenced by pre-existing associations</p>

                <li>Stereotypes may also disrupt learning via ‘second-order’ effects due to taxed cognitive functioning</li>

          <h3>Method</h3>
          <h4>Participants</h4>
          <P>Participants (N = 696 across 3 studies) were recruited from the University of California SONA pool. The sample had a mean age of 20.01, SD = 3.32 (63% self-identified female, and 37% self-identified male) and was 43% Asian, 28% Latino, 11% White, 8% Other, and 6% Black. </P>
          <h4>Personality Measures</h4>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12 col-10-medium">
              <ul>
                <li>Internal Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice (Omega = .85)</li>
                <li>External Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice (Omega = .79)</li>
                <li>Social Dominance Orientation (Omega = .81)</li>

          </div>
          <h4>Procedure</h4>
          <P>Schematic of the learning task in the Crime Face (A) and Weather Cloud (B) conditions. Participants learned the probabilities of the card patterns by selecting their choice and receiving feedback as to if they were correct or incorrect (right side of stimuli) as well as what the actual outcome was on that trial (left side of stimuli).</P>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <h4>Growth Modeling</h4>
          <p>To examine differences in learning across conditions, we estimated a logistic mixed model regressing accuracy onto a dummy coded factor for condition, as well as a continuous variable for time.
          <p><p></p>

            <P>Participants exhibited learning disruptions in the social compared to nonsocial learning context, despite repeated instructions that the social and non-social stimuli were unrelated to the outcome (Studies 1-2)<p>

          <h3>Discussion</h3>
            <p>These findings bear several important theoretical implications. First, First, probabilistic category learning is integral to how people learn about the world through trial and error,
                yet extant research has not yet examined how pre-existing associations interfere with this learning process. We demonstrate that pre-existing associations can interfere with new learning.
                Second, different classes of pre-existing associations that people hold may impact new learning. Our results suggest that there is something unique about pre-existing social associations about race that disrupt learning, as these contexts led to significantly worse learning rates compared to a nonsocial context.
                Third, we interrogate how stereotypes disrupt learning and demonstrate that cognitive demands of regulating responses that may appear prejudiced can disrupt learning as it unfolds in real time.
