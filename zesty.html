                <h2>Zesty: Crafting the Future of Social Cooking</h2>
            </div>
            <hr />
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, countless individuals rediscovered their passion for home cooking. To meet their need for a centralized platform to organize, share, and explore recipes, Zesty was conceived - a social cooking platform that empowers home cooks, ignites inspiration, and streamlines recipe management. </p>
            <h3>Objective: Building a User-Centric Platform</h3>
            <p>Leveraging my expertise in UX/UI design, web development, and data analysis, I aimed to create an intuitive social cooking platform that simplifies recipe creation, organization, and sharing. <a href="https://www.getzesty.app/">Try it yourself!</a></p>

            <hr />

            <h4>Data-Driven Market Validation</h4>
            <p>To assess the demand for a platform like Zesty, I utilized my research skills to survey a representative sample of 900 active home cooks using CloudResearch. The study revealed that 83% of respondents use multiple methods to organize their recipes, with the majority expressing dissatisfaction with their current system. An impressive 87% expressed interest in using Zesty to manage their recipes.</p>

                    <img src="images/methods.jpg"  alt="Methods" style="width:100%">

                <div class="column">

                </div>
            </div>
            <hr />

            <h4>User-Focused Recipe Creation Flow</h4>
            <p>Employing an iterative design process, I conducted 30+ usability tests over two months to perfect the recipe creation workflow. This user-centric approach allowed me to refine the platform's design and maximize user experience, demonstrating my commitment to delivering a product that meets users' needs and expectations.</p>

            <h4>Innovative Recipe Importing Feature</h4>
            <p>Capitalizing on my Python programming skills, I developed a script to scrape metadata from various recipe websites, allowing users to effortlessly import recipes from their favorite sources into the Zesty platform. Currently, I am spearheading the development of a new feature that enables recipe imports based on images. The front-end design is under construction, with plans to launch this innovative feature in the coming year. </p>

<!--                <p>To validate our intuitions that people really do struggle to organize and share their recipes, we conducted several surveys using a representative sample via CloudResearch (total N=900).
